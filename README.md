# About
Rolled is an anime-based website that recommends anime across all genres. Users can hover over any anime to watch a trailer and view detailed information, including a brief description, release year, author, genres, animation studio, and other works by the author. While watching the trailer, users are prompted to continue watching the series on Crunchyroll with a direct link.

# Future idea
In the future, analytics can be added if the Crunchyroll API is found.
